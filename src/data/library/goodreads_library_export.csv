I wanted to understand the illiad and its background, but this book only explains the plot and an inspid poetics analysis of each chapter/book of the Illiad. It's like reading a summary of the story, which was not what i was looking for. I expected to find an explanation of the Iliad idea of virtue, of the hero, of their cosmology, of their mythology, etc.<br/><br/>The book summary one can find in wikipedia is richer than the one of this book.",,,1,0

He uses his knowledge of classical history and evolution to create metaphors so that the reader may understand his ideas to a greater degree. I love that.<br/><br/>I read about 30% of the book, since it is in that part that Robert talks about mastery in the context of University/Work/etc., which is not useful for me in this moment, for I'm in the prior stage: Figuring out what subject to master. And this book was very helpful in helping me figure it out.<br/>I would have liked if he had picked different geniuses as examples of mastery, for I think some of the ones he picked are relevant and insightful, but I think many historical polymaths were better examples. Also, I think he had an opportunity to discuss mastery in a broader sense, and include subjects such as learning as a lifestyle, routines, mindsets, and other things that history's polymaths' lives can help us with.",,,1,0

Events shrank, and it feels like everything that regards his adulthood happened very quickly and vaguely, for it seems like he didn't want to talk about his adulthood. Ironically, he was very open about his fantasies and dreams, yet not about his life and study (at least in his biography)",,,1,0

The conclusion is nonsense, since not even the island's inhabitants know why they live so long, and credit incorrect things, like ""smiling"" and ""working on something you love"". Also, the authors study the island culture and habits, and try to find what makes these people live for even more than 100 years, and end up in common sense conclusions: walk daily, eat until you're 80% full and be happy.<br/>If you came here looking to ""find your ikigai"", this book isn't for you either. It talks about it without having understood it in its depths. <br/><br/>I could have taken more value out of my time if I would have read a couple of Wikipedia entries about ""ikigai"" and its related subject.",,,1,0
