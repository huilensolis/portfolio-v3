### Database and Authentication

Pictura leverages **[Supabase](https://www.supabase.com)** as its backend, using **PostgreSQL** for data storage. The authentication system is powered by Supabase, offering email and GitHub login integrations.

### Image Handling

For image management, Pictura integrates with **[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)**, a REST API that allows to upload, delete, retrieve, and optimize images.

### Performance Optimization

To enhance user experience, Pictura implements **Image Lazy Loading**. This ensures that only images within the user's viewport are loaded, reducing unnecessary bandwidth usage and improving performance. Additionally, a loading skeleton is displayed for images that are still being fetched, creating a smoother visual experience.
