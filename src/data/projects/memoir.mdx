# Memoir

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/huilensolis/memoir) - [Live Website](https://memoir-oak.vercel.app/)

**Memoir** is a web-based text editor.

The idea for Memoir came when I was evaluating different note-taking editors to organize and write my documents. I explored Obsidian, a desktop app, and Notion, a web app. While both are great for taking notes, they each have drawbacks: Obsidian is limited to the desktop, and I wanted a browser-based solution, while Notion uses user data for advertising and AI training. To address these issues, I built my own solution: a simple, open-source text editor on the web.

## Key Features:

- **User Authentication:** A custom-built authentication system.
- **Text Editor:** A rich text editor that supports Markdown and includes a Notion-like slash command palette.
- **Document Synchronization:** Documents are saved in a PostgreSQL database for persistence, with a debounce feature to optimize network resources when updating documents.
- **Document CRUD:** Create, read, update, and delete documents.

## Technical Overview

- **Turborepo:** For managing monorepos.
- **GitHub Pipelines (CI/CD):** For running tests, type checking, and linting on each pull request.

---

- **Next.js:** For server-side rendering, server actions, data streaming, and optimized performance.
- **TypeScript:** Ensuring type safety and robust code.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first, responsive styling.
- **Tip-Tap:** For setting up a rich text editor.
- **Axios:** An HTTP client.
- **Zustand:** A lightweight state management solution.
- **React Hook Form:** For client-side form validation and handling.
- **Playwright:** End-to-end testing.

- **Bun:** A JavaScript runtime.
- **Elysia JS:** An API REST framework x21 times faster than Express.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database.
- **DrizzleORM:** SQL ORM.
- **Bun Test:** Unit testing.
- **Typebox:** Input validation.
- **Swagger:** API documentation.
