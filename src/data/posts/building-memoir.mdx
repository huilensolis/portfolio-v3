# Building Memoir: My journey creating an encrypted web-based text document editor

## The Inspiration Behind Memoir
For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by text editors. There’s something inherently beautiful about them—their simplicity and elegance. I had always wanted to build one of them.

When preparing for my next project, I decided to tackle both backend and frontend development while experimenting with [Bun](https://bun.sh), a JavaScript runtime, and [Elysia](https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia/), a REST API framework for Bun. I wanted to create something new—not just another clone of a famous website—something I would personally use.

That’s how I came up with the idea for **Memoir**, an encrypted, web-based document editor. The vision was clear:

- **Privacy:** Not even administrators (or myself) should be able to access user data—not hackers, not anyone.
- **Simplicity:** Focus solely on writing, without the distractions of images, tables, or complex formatting.

## The Development Journey

### Laying the Foundation
Creating the editor was my first challenge. I experimented with various options such as `<textarea>`, `<input>`, and `contenteditable`, but none of them did a good job. That’s when I discovered [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev), a library built on ProseMirror.

While TipTap is now a robust tool with extensive documentation, back then, it required persistence to debug issues and learn its intricacies. It ultimately became the backbone of Memoir’s editing capabilities.

### Defining the Tech Stack
With the editor foundation in place, I defined the tech stack:

**Frontend:**
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- TipTap
- Components from ShadCN
- Axios

**Backend:**
- Bun
- Elysia.js
- PostgreSQL
- DrizzleORM
- Bun Test
- TypeBox
- Docker

**Code Organization:**
- Monorepo layout with Turborepo for managing both frontend and backend.

### Building the Basics
I started with the essential features:
- Dockerized the database
- Databse basic tables to save user info
- Login and signup pages.
- Authentication system to restrict access to specific routes.
- An authenticated user’s home page (the "app" page).
- A dropdown menu displaying the current user and a logout button.

### Overcoming Challenges
One significant challenge arose while building the slash menu (a Notion-like menu triggered by typing `/`). At the time, TipTap’s package for this functionality was only available for Vue, not React. To address this, I built the feature from scratch. It was a rewarding process, and within a few days, I had it fully functional.

### Making Changes Persistent
Once the frontend was complete, I connected it to the backend to save documents in a PostgreSQL database. However, saving on every change generated multiple requests per second. To optimize this:

- I implemented a **debounce**: Changes are saved only after the user stops typing for 1-2 seconds.
- To prevent data loss, I added an **auto-save** feature: Changes are saved every 5 seconds, regardless of user activity.
- A **confirmation dialog** prompts users to wait for the document to save before leaving the page.
- A "saving/saved" status ui element that provides real-time feedback on the document’s state.

## Feedback and Iteration
After deploying Memoir’s API, database, and frontend, I shared the project on Discord to gather feedback. A user reported that the slash menu wasn’t working in Firefox. 

After debugging, I discovered that a condition for displaying the menu always returned false in Firefox due to an undefined variable. Once fixed, I implemented Playwright tests to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

### Lessons from Testing
While Playwright worked, its maintenance and community support were less than ideal. Compatibility with Bun was another challenge. In hindsight, I might have chosen a different tool, but Playwright got the job done.

I also added GitHub Actions to test and format new branches before merging them into production. Additionally, I introduced a list of recent entries in the sidebar and a modal menu for searching entries by title.

### Encrypting the Data
The project’s core value was privacy, which meant encryption was essential. I had no prior knowledge of cryptography, so this was a steep learning curve. 

Using the browser’s native `crypto` API, I implemented AES encryption. This ensured that:
- Encryption keys are generated, stored securely, and never shared with the server.
- Documents are encrypted/decrypted on the client side.

Adapting the database schema to support encryption introduced challenges, especially ensuring backward compatibility with existing data. However, the effort was worth it to uphold the project’s commitment to privacy.

## Challenges and Solutions
Some bugs, like the slash menu issue in Firefox, required long debugging sessions. Others were quicker to resolve. The key lesson: patience, adaptability, and a willingness to learn are vital.

**Key takeaways:**
- Always write tests, especially unit and end-to-end tests.
- Evaluate libraries for documentation quality, community support, and API stability before integrating them.

## Learning and Growth
This project was a massive learning experience. Key areas of growth included:
- Project management and task organization.
- CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Playwright end-to-end testing.
- AES encryption and secure data storage on the browser.
- Working with cookies, Turborepo, and more.

## final conclution 
I’ve realized that you can achieve anything with clear goals and a determination to learn. You can build whatever you want; you just need to find what you want to build, and then learn how to do it. This project is an example of it.
